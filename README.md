# Exploratory_Data_Analysis-Project

🌍 Global Population Analyzer – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Tech Stack: Python (Jupyter/Anaconda), Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Role: Data Analyst
Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda), World Bank Dataset

📌 Project Overview:
This project explores global population trends from 1970 to 2022 using data sourced from the World Bank. Through comprehensive data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visual exploration, the aim was to derive insights about demographic shifts and growth patterns across continents and countries.

🎯 Objectives:
Analyze long-term global population growth and density trends.

Explore regional variations and identify high-growth zones.

Assess the impact of population growth on environment and resources.

Project future population estimates based on historical trends.

📈 Key Insights & Visuals:
Asia remains the most populous continent; Africa shows highest growth rate.

Heatmaps and scatter plots revealed correlations between population density, land area, and growth rate.

Box plots showed variability in growth rates by continent.

Used projection formula to estimate future populations up to 2032.

🛠 Tasks Performed:
Cleaned missing values and outliers.

Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

Used line plots, box plots, and heatmaps to visualize trends.

Generated hypotheses and validated them with data visualizations.
