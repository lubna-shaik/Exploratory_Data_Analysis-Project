## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores global population trends from **1970 to 2022** using data sourced from the **World Bank**. Through comprehensive data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visual exploration, the goal was to derive insights about demographic shifts and growth patterns across continents and countries.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze long-term global population growth and density trends.
- Explore regional variations and identify high-growth zones.
- Assess the impact of population growth on environment and resources.
- Project future population estimates based on historical trends.

---

## 📈 Key Insights & Visuals
- **Asia** remains the most populous continent; **Africa** shows the highest growth rate.
- Heatmaps and scatter plots reveal correlations between population density, land area, and growth rate.
- Box plots show variability in growth rates by continent.
- Used a projection formula to estimate future populations up to **2032**.

---

## 🛠 Tasks Performed
- Cleaned missing values and handled outliers.
- Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
- Used line plots, box plots, and heatmaps to visualize trends.
- Generated hypotheses and validated them with data visualizations.
